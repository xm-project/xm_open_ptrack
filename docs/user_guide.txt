--- People tracking test with one Kinect and without extrinsic calibration ---
Connect a Microsoft Kinect for XBOX360 and run:
roslaunch tracking detection_and_tracking.launch

You should see an RGB image with people detections surrounded by white rectangles and ROS visualizer showing a top view of people centroids.



--- Change confidence threshold for people detection ---
In the file '<open_ptrack_main_folder>/detection/conf/haar_disp_ada_detector.yaml', you can set the threshold for people detection by changing 'haar_disp_ada_min_confidence' parameter.



--- Change confidence threshold for track initialization ---
Single-camera tracking:
In the file '<open_ptrack_main_folder>/tracking/conf/tracker.yaml', you can set the threshold for track initialization by changing 'min_confidence_initialization' parameter.

Multi-camera tracking:
In the file '<open_ptrack_main_folder>/tracking/conf/tracker_multicamera.yaml', you can set the threshold for track initialization by changing 'min_confidence_initialization' parameter.


--- Multicamera people tracking test with extrinsic calibration ---
Follow steps written in 'docs/multicamera_calibration_guide.doc'.



--- Listening to tracking messages ---
For listening to tracking output messages, two options are available:
a) for reading tracking messages in YAML format:
rostopic echo /tracker/tracks
b) for reading tracking JSON-formatted messages sent via UDP:
roslaunch opt_utils udp_listener.launch
For this last option, UDP and JSON parameters can be set in '<open_ptrack_main_folder>/opt_utils/conf/json_udp.yaml'.



--- Stopping execution ---
For stopping execution, press 'Ctrl'+'C' or kill the people detection process as follows:
killall -9 ground_based_people_detector



--- Methods for ground plane estimation ---
In the file '<open_ptrack_main_folder>/detection/conf/ground_based_people_detector.yaml', you can choose the method to use for ground plane estimation by changing the 'ground_estimation_mode' parameter.

Possible values are:

0: Manual mode 
The user is asked to click on three ground plane points.
When the point cloud appears, press Shift+LeftClick on 3 (non collinear) points of the ground plane. Then, press 'Q'. 

1: Semi-automatic mode
The software finds and shows all planes and ask the user to Shift+LeftClick on the ground plane (just one click). Then, press 'Q'.

2: Automatic mode with result visualization
The software automatically estimates the ground plane and shows it in red in PCL visualizer. Press 'Q' to start people tracking.

3: Automatic mode, no result visualization
The software automatically estimates the ground plane and starts tracking people. The result of ground plane estimation is not shown.



ADVANCED TOPICS

--- Kinect driver ---
Both open source Kinect drivers (OpenNI, Freenect) are installed with OpenPTrack.
The default driver is OpenNI, but it could not work on all machines (in some cases, the point cloud is not published).
For using the Freenect driver, you only need to change the KINECT_DRIVER environment variable  written at the bottom of the .bashrc file in your home folder.
Possible values are: "openni" or "freenect".


GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING
